This is a simple project about connnecting a database to consoleApp


you need to restore database 'ContactsDB' before you test :)

Three-Tier Architecture:
=>Presentation Layer (UI):

*Responsible for user interaction.
*Displays data to the user and collects input.
*In our case, it will be the console application.

=>Business Logic Layer (BLL):

*Contains business rules and logic.
*Validates input, processes data, and communicates with the data access layer.

=>Data Access Layer (DAL):

*Handles database operations (CRUD: Create, Read, Update, Delete).
*Connects to the database and executes queries.
